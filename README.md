# Project Overview

The purpose of this project for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree is to demonstrate the value in test-driven development by completing the missing test suites. Udacity have provided the initial web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework has already been set up and a first test suite included.


## How to run the application

Clone or download the [repo](https://github.com/josephine-mattina/feed-reader-testing) and open `index.html` in a web browser.
